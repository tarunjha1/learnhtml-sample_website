    <h1> The Learn Enough Story </h1>
      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
        benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join
        our movement,

    <h2> Background </h2>
        <p>
          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the

          <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
          This page is part of the sample site for
          <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML to

    <h2> Founders </h2>
      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
        Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
        sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
        <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em>, and probably more.
